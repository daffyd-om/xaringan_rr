* In epidemiology, we are concerned with the degree to which a particular exposure might cause (or prevent) a particular disease. ls for example, eating in kanteens associated to amr gene expression in our microbiota?

*let me stress the word association because claim causal effects is not that easy from a single epidemiologic study; thus, we say instead that exposures and diseases are (or are not) associated. 

* The degree of association between exposures and health outcomes can be estimated through measures of association. this is the case of Risk ratio. This chapter will therefore provide a concise explanation of Risk ratio, which is also known as a relative risk and cumulative incidence ratio

*so let me start by saying that RR is a measure used in cohort studies. 

*what is a cohort defined most broadly as “any designated group of individuals who are followed over a period of time.” IN SIMPLE TERMS WE WILL REFER TO two cohorts, exposed and unexposed,

*A cohort study,
involves measuring the occurrence of disease within one or more cohorts.


* LET'S SEE NOW A COHORT DESIGN

class:top, center

## .left[Sampling]



???
* we rarely conduct studies on entire populations because they are too big for it to be logistically feasible to study everyone in the population. Therefore we draw a sample and perform the study with the individuals in the sample. For a cohort study, since we will be calculating incidence, we must start with individuals who are at risk of the outcome.

# Two by two table &#9775;

* I like to see a 2by2 table as a dualism data summary
* Before getting into RR, it is important to understand the notation used in epidemiology to convey exposure and disease data: the 
**2 x 2 table is a compact summary of data for 2 variables from a study—namely, the exposure and the health outcome
*a are diseased +  and exposed +
*b are number of no cases (no diseased) exposed,
*c are number of cases (disease) no exposed,
*d are number of no cases (no diseased) no exposed

### two-by-two table &#9775;

--

```{r 2by222, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra); library(tidyverse); library(epiR)
by2 <- matrix(c("a" , "b" , "c" , "d"), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(by2) <- c("E +", "E -"); 
colnames(by2) <- c("D +", "D -") 
by2df <- as.table(by2)
by2df %>%
  kbl(caption = "2 by 2 table") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
  #kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
#pander(by2df, caption = "A 2 by 2 contigency matrix/table")
```

--

### Risk ratio

--

$$RR =\frac{a}{a+ b}/\frac{c}{c+d}$$


--



### Interpretation


--

.left[RR > 1 Exposure associated with higher risk of outcome]

.left[RR < 1 Exposure associated with lower risk of outcome]

.left[RR = 1 Risk is comparable in both cohorts]


---
class:top, left
???
*another point estimate well known an highly used in epi studies is the OR
*it is so common reported, because it is the estimate from logistic regression analysis


--


## Risk ratio friend:

--

### Odds ratio 


--



$$OR=\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}}$$




--




$$OR=\frac{a \times d}{b \times c}$$



--


###Example:

--


.pull-left[
```{r 2by2222, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra); library(tidyverse); library(epiR)
by2 <- matrix(c("90" , "60" , "30" , "120"), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(by2) <- c("E +", "E -"); 
colnames(by2) <- c("D +", "D -") 
by2df <- as.table(by2)
by2df %>%
  kbl(caption = "2 by 2 table") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
  #kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
#pander(by2df, caption = "A 2 by 2 contigency matrix/table")
```
]

.pull-right[

```{r, or, highlight.output = 1}
OR = (90 / 60) / (30 / 120)
OR
```
]

---
class: bottom,left

???
*the OR is larger than RR; this an overestimation of the exposure as a risk. if the rr is smaller than 1 the or will underestimate the exposure as a preventive factor. Only when the prevalence or incidence is small the RR and OR will tend to be equal. you will see that OR is so common reported in epi studiesand  it is because it is the estimate from logistic regression analysis. 
*Nevertheless for cohort studies RR should be given preference over OR

--


## Intrepeting OR and RR

--


```{r, or2, highlight.output = TRUE}
(OR2 = (90 * 120) / (30 * 60))
```

--



```{r, rr45, highlight.output = TRUE}
(RR = ((90) / (90 + 60)) / ((30) / (30 + 120)))
```

--



&#9758; OR = 6; the odds of disease in exposed individuals is six times higher than in the unexposed


--

&#9755; RR = 3; The incidence of disease in exposed is three times higher than in the unexposed
